How do they want the user interface to be? brand new UI or a voice overlay on navUP current app.

Must they be able to navigate using the GPS as they cannot see the map and GPS is only accurate upto 5m radius? if so should it be voice activated and how should we handle the accuracy ?

For the sensors how are we planning to power them?

Can we get all the building data to map the university for the GIS modules?

Can we get a real server from UP to use?
