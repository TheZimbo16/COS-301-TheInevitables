How do they want the user interface to be? brand new UI or a voice overlay on navUP current app.

Must they be able to navigate using the GPS as they cannot see the map and GPS is only accurate upto 5m radius? if so should it be voice activated and how should we handle the accuracy ? // Comment: This is a compound question that should be broken up. Also, the accuracy is a technical point, which the client may not understand. It might be best to mention that accuracy will be a significant obstacle. This will only be understood by Morkel

Related to the question above: What is the lowest degree of reliability that is acceptable? //This directly impacts the project cost in terms of bill of materials as well as technical expertise and time to develop, since a higher degree of reliablility requires more sensitive hardware and a greater degree of expertise to implement.

For the sensors how are we planning to power them? //Also, a very technical point, which the client will likely not be able to answer. We can give the client options, but the options should be conveyed from a budget and ergonomic perspective in a way that the client can understand.

Can we get all the building data to map the university for the GIS modules?// Who should we approach to get the GIS data of the campus? This is perhaps something we should talk to Vreda about, or ask Morkel?

Can we get a real server from UP to use?//Ask Morkel or Vreda?

Have you approached the university for project approval and funding?

Follow up question. What are the budgetary constraints?

Inform the client of the risks that we have identified. This part can get technical, but there is no way around it since the risk is only visible from a technical standpoint.(see risk_analysis file)
