First Meeting Questions:

How do they want the user interface to be? brand new UI or a voice overlay on navUP current app.

Must they be able to navigate using the GPS as they cannot see the map and GPS is only accurate upto 5m radius? if so should it be voice activated and how should we handle the accuracy ? // Comment: This is a compound question that should be broken up. Also, the accuracy is a technical point, which the client may not understand. It might be best to mention that accuracy will be a significant obstacle. This will only be understood by Morkel

Related to the question above: What is the lowest degree of reliability that is acceptable? //This directly impacts the project cost in terms of bill of materials as well as technical expertise and time to develop, since a higher degree of reliablility requires more sensitive hardware and a greater degree of expertise to implement.

For the sensors how are we planning to power them? //Also, a very technical point, which the client will likely not be able to answer. We can give the client options, but the options should be conveyed from a budget and ergonomic perspective in a way that the client can understand.

Can we get all the building data to map the university for the GIS modules?// Who should we approach to get the GIS data of the campus? This is perhaps something we should talk to Vreda about, or ask Morkel?

Can we get a real server from UP to use?//Ask Morkel or Vreda?

Have you approached the university for project approval and funding?

Follow up question. What are the budgetary constraints?

Inform the client of the risks that we have identified. This part can get technical, but there is no way around it since the risk is only visible from a technical standpoint.(see risk_analysis file)

Second meeting questions:
Will the blind user be using a cane with the app?
Will the blind user be using a guide dog with the app?
Will the blind user be using the app without a dog or a cane?
What are the main issues on campus for the blind that the app could address?(Here we will need to manage the client's expectations if it is not feasible)
That is, what difficulties do blind people have on campus that can be addressed by this app?
What obstacles did you have in mind?
May we write the app in such a way that navigation for the blind follow the physically disabled routes exclusively?
Maybe discuss the line following proposal since we don't know our budget yet.
Perhaps discuss the progress on the budget.
When will we get access to blind users in order to finish the SRS?
For proof of concept may we restrict our development to the android platform? This makes it easier for us to implement the proof of concept features using opencv. We also don't need access to a mac computer to deploy the app for usability testing.
How do blind people who regularly visit campus enter the campus?
How do blind people who visit campus for the first time find the disability unit?
What is the protocol for when a blind person visits campus for the first time?

Questions not intended for Maria since it is technical in nature:
What region of campus would you have us demonstrate proof of concept?
Will we have to capture the GIS map data ourselves, or is it available somewhere?(We can also do our own research on this question no one knows)

A note to the group:
We will have a much happier client if we under promise and over deliver. So try not to grow the scope or make big commitments.
