\subsubsection{Experimental setup}
Our experiment consists of two data sets. The first data set is a 2 minute hand-held video footage pointing at the marker that has been measured beforehand at 7 metres away, while the second is a marker at 3 metres away. To illuminate the marker a single 40w incandescent bulb was used at 1.8 metres away from the subject, which yields approximately 14 lux of illuminance. To put it into perspective, a typical library will have an illumination of 500 lux.

\subsection{Other field tests}
On the outdoors test one notices rare and spurious false positive tag identification, specifically tag id 17. There are a number of remediation strategies that one could employ to reduce the likelihood of false positives or even elimitate them entirely for all intents and purposes.

\subsubsection{Emperical elimination of bad tags}
