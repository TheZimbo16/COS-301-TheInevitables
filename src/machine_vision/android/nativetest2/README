You will notice in app/CMakeList.txt there are 2 path variables that need to be set for your environment.
The first one `pathToProject` is simply the path to the root directory of the android studio project.
The second variable is the path to the android implementation of opencv compiled with the script that I modified from https://github.com/tzutalin/build-opencv-for-android.

To set the second path, download and unpack the android implementation of opencv from here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6HViLClzcELM0dpMWZQbWVoSlE and place it at some arbitrary path that you prefer. Just remember to set the second path to that location.

Lastly download and unpack the compiled library files into app/src/main/jniLibs. The compiled library files can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6HViLClzcELSWJxTDJMYUlDak0.
