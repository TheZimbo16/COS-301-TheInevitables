# COS-301-TheInevitables
Team repository for the Inevitables, we successfully tendered the DU@UP Obeject sensor and mobile navigation project.
This project will be referred to as NavUP.

The SRS has been compiled and can be found here: [NavUP SRS](./Documentation/TheInevitables_SRS.pdf)

## Motivation
Similar to existing navigation applications such as Google Maps and Waze, the NavUP is a standalone
mobile application that acts as a campus navigation system for students both with and without disabil-
ities. It encompasses many technologies which will be required to provide the requested and necessary
functionality as described in the functional requirements section of the SRS.
