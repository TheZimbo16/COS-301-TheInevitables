Reach RTK kit:
	Description: Real time kinematics allows for centimeter resolution global positioning.
	Relevance to the project: If we can obtain centimeter resolution GPS coordinates then safe routes are possible to map.
		Conventional GPS is only accurate withing 2m, which not sufficient for obstacle avoidance.
		In addition, this device can interface with an android device, serving as a substitute for the built in GPS.
		Furthermore, since this is a complete IMU, we can implement fall detection and response since the fall can be detected by the accelerometer and the location determined by communications with the base station.
		It has a built in intel edison SOC, so extending and changing the system to our needs will be possible.
	Cost:$570 for two devices, one is the base station
	Sensors: GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope
	Platform: Intel edison
	Connectivity: Wifi, bluetooth, USB otg, UART, I2C


Low level technology choices:
	-Bluetooth
	-UHF RFID
	-Ultrason sensors
	-Doppler Radars
	-Lidar scanners
	-Time of flight lasers
	-Infrared proximity sensors
	-QR codes (this one could be very useful and cheap)
