What is relevant to Maria, that is, what should we prioritise so that Maria can see it before she must leave?
	-Remember, she went out of her way to attend the demo, so we should have something specific to show her to make it worth her while.
	-Perhaps we could start off with asking her if she has any questions she would like to ask?
	-....

Android app:
	-Map with scrolling
	-GPS
	-Login
	-General style and feel

Backend serverside:
	-User creation?
	-Demonstration of wildfly->nginx setup. How will this part be demonstrated?
	-Restfull API over http

Backend androidside:
	-Machine vision
		-Marker identification. Mention range and limitations as well as field tests with video footage if needed.
		-Ground and wall plane triangulation. Should we show this part?
		-If time allows, let the lecturers and client play around with the cardboard marker?

Frontend besides the android app:
	???

Other items:
	-Proof of project management
		-Burndown chart
		-Waffle kanban cards
		-Regular meetings and meetups during the holiday
	-Coding standards
		-Not needed so far since code is mostly experimental to see what works and what does not.
		-Enforcing coding standards would have slowed down exploration.
	-Budget constraints:
		-Could we perhaps be provided with credits on amazon, azure or google cloud for a testing server for everyone to connect to?
			-Motivations for why this is essential...

Order of the way the items could be mentioned in the meeting:
17:00
	-Maria's stuff, whatever that might be
	-The current look and feel of the app?
	-Tag identification? Or do we leave this for after she has left?
	-Thank Maria for taking the time in her busy schedule to attend.
17:30(Maria leaves)
	-Only mention proof of project management if asked
	-Only provide architecture if asked
	-Only mention coding standards motivation if asked
	-Backend serverside
	-Frontend web interface if any
	-Machine vision stuff to play around with
	-Thank the lecturers for their time
