\section{High level description}
A mobile navigation application that allows for the independent navigation of persons with visual disabilities. The combination of technologies, navigation systems and low tech devices will help students navigate their way on campus safely and successfully. 

\subsection{Software and Hardware Characteristics:}
The mobile application should make use of bluetooth tags that enables the localisation and distance of an obstacle. The bluetooth transmitters communicate with a students mobile device to send information of the students position and determine distance from the obstacle. The creation of obstacle sensors will reliably detect when a student is getting too close to an obstacle. The application should also include a short series of audible beeps to notify a student of an impending obstacle. The application should work indoors and outdoors at UP Route speech navigation. The software should adhere to all UP policies and should be free of any malicious code.

\subsection{System requirements:}
The application should be developed to be downloaded and installed on devices from Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store.
It should comply with the most recent web accessibility guidelines and should also be percievable, operable, understandable and robust.
The obstacle sensors should be enabled via bluetooth.
The application should work cross platform (iOS, Android, Windows, Mobile Web), Device formats would include phones and tablets. Navigation should work through the use of WiFi Access point data.

\subsection{Possible Project Name}
NavUP

\section{Proposed Solution}

\subsection{Technologies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item J2EE
	\item JDBC
	\item JPA
	\item Wildfly 10
	\item MongoDB
\end{itemize}
Note that during the course of the development some technologies may be included/ excluded based on the needs of the system.

\subsubsection{Description}
We intend to use a microservices architecture which provides loose coupling and high cohesion between a set of individually created modules. There will in essence be four modules, where each module can have an independent architecture if necessary. The modules will be data, notifications, GIS, Access. The mobile application will be used to find locations and navigate to them, this will include the audible beeps, the rest of the modules will be used to gather information about locations on campus, as well as coordinates for these locations(indoors and outdoors).
\section{Development Methodology}
We will be using the Agile Scrum Methodology. By making a backlog of work to be done and by completing deadlines in short iterations or sprints. We will meet daily by making use of  Slack Messaging Platform to discuss the progress as well as obstacles and how to overcome these obstacles by getting input from each member. We will also define when these deadlines are and make sure we keep to the schedule. We will meet everytime we are done with a deadline to reflect on the work done. \\ \\
At each deadline or meeting we will make sure we meet with the client to make sure that they are kept up to date with our progress. We will also meet with the client when there are concerns or obstacles to overcome to make sure the client knows about these obstacles. The client will be kept up to date each week with the progress of the project.
\section{Cost Analysis}
The estimated cost to develop both software and hardware to be determined by UP Department of Computer Science.

\section{Risk Analysis}
\subsection{Privacy}
The Protection of Personal Information Act, No 4 of 2013, is applicable in this project due to data collection of personal information. We caution that due diligence be exercised when deploying the system within a UP campus. The act requires that the data subject gives consent. Compliance with the act has additional implications for security, custody of the collected data and how it may be processed.

\subsection{Security}
There are security concerns regarding the use of  the sensors that are involved. Precautions will have to be taken to ensure that students/lecturers' information and access to these sensors are limited to only those who need access.
