\section{Introduction}
From preliminary research we have indentified numerous key issues that need to be addressed in order to realise the product. A good deal of this document is dedicated to proposed solutions to these key issues, most of which lies between the track outdoors and the server indoors. That being said, we have come up with some added value features that we think the athletes will enjoy, which will hopefully lead to faster adoption and usage of the new system. The document is layed out such that we discuss solutions on the front-end first, after which we will move to backend and hardware. 

For this project we would like to use a raspberry PI or similar device to be able to allow communication between the RFID reader and the tag. As well as using the
device to upload data to a centralized database, this can be done using a WIFI network. This database will then be accessed by a website to which the runners will be able to view their individual results and live analysis on the data for the runner, this will be done using PostgreSQL to ensure there are no issues with high usage. This website should be viewable on any device,including mobile.This will be done using the Twitter Bootstrap framework,which can dynamically change the site according to the device size.

\section{Proposed Solution}

\section{Development Methodology}
We will be using the Agile Methodology. By making a backlog of work to be done and by completing deadlines in short iterations or sprints. We will meet daily by making use of  Slack Messaging Platform to discuss the progress as well as obstacles and how to overcome these obstacles by getting input from each member. We will also define when these deadlines are and make sure we keep to the schedule. We will meet everytime we are done with a deadline to reflect on the work done. \\ \\
At each deadline or meeting we will meet with the client to make sure that they are kept up to date with our progress. We will also meet with the client when there are concerns or obstacles to overcome to make sure the client aware about obstacles we are facing. The client will be kept up to date each week with the progress of the project.
