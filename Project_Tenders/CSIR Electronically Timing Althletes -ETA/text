\section{High level description}
For this project we would like to use a raspberry PI or similar device to be able to allow communication between the RFID reader and the tag. As well as using the
device to upload data to a centralized database, this can be done using python and wifi. This database will then be accessed by a website to which the runners will be able to view their individual results and live analysis
on the data for the runner, this will be done using postgreSQL to ensure there are no issues with high usage. This website should be viewable on any device,including mobile.This will be
done using bootstrap,which can dynamically change the site according to the device size.
