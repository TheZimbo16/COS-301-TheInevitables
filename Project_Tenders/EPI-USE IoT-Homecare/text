\section{High level description}
A home care system that takes advantage of the Internet of Things. The system will make use of existing devices and sensors to deliver a holistic system for monitoring homecare patients.The system will gather details from a patient from the devices and sensors and communicate them in a generic manner using Wi-Fi with the caregivers through a mobile application and EPI-USE's cloud server (EPI-USE IoT Homecare pdf.2017)

\subsubsection{Description}
We intend to primarily make use of three types of devices that will be used for the system. These devices will use the Raspberry Pi as a communication device between the webserver containing the application API and the EPI-USE cloud where data will be stored. This will ensure that if the Raspberry Pi breaks or is under certain circumstances rendered inoperable that it be the only loss and that no important data be lost along with it. A mobile application will also be developed for use by the caretaker. This application will gather information and alert care givers if there is an emergency. We will be using a microservices architecture where each microservice can be managed, developed and released independently. \\ \\ \\The devices that will be used are:\\ \\
\textbf{Infrared Sensors} \\
There are two ways in which we intend to use theses sensors. The first being a sensored triggered light beneath the bed. When a person gets up from the bed at night a light mounted beneath the bed will be switched on. Giving the person enough light to move around. This is to address the problem of elderly people falling down at night while trying to move around their living space. The next way we intend to use this technology is using these sensors to detect when a person is falling down the stairs and to notify the caregivers when this happens. \\ \\
\textbf{Remote Control} \\
A remote control device is to be used by the patient select which meal they would like to eat along with what they want to drink. This information can be used to derive the likes and dislikes of a patient and so help the caregivers understand what the patient likes and dislikes. \\ \\
\textbf{Cameras} \\
Cameras are to be used in case of an emergency. If a patient falls down or if an event occurs that might register as an emergency an alarm is triggerd and the caregivers are alerted. Allowing them to observe the patients by means of a camera and determine whether there is in fact an emergency and act upon it.

\section{Development Methodology}
We will be using the Agile Scrum Methodology. By making a backlog of work to be done and by completing deadlines in short iterations or sprints. We will meet daily by making use of  Slack Messaging Platform to discuss the progress as well as obstacles and how to overcome these obstacles by getting input from each member. We will also define when these deadlines are and make sure we keep to the schedule. We will meet everytime we are done with a deadline to reflect on the work done. \\ \\
At each deadline or meeting we will make sure we meet with the client to make sure that they are kept up to date with our progress. We will also meet with the client when there are concerns or obstacles to overcome to make sure the client knows  about these obstacles. The client will be kept up to date each week with the progress of the project.

\section{Risk Analysis}
\subsection{Privacy}
The Protection of Personal Information Act, No 4 of 2013, is applicable in this project due to data collection of personal information. We caution that due diligence be exercised when deploying the system withing a home. The act requires that the data subject gives consent or in the case of a patient with dementia, that the guardian of the patient gives consent for data collection. Compliance with the act has additional implications for security, custody of the collected data and how it may be processed.

\subsection{Security}
There are security concerns regarding the use of cameras and sensors are involved. Precautions will have to be taken to ensure that patients information and access to these cameras and sensors are limited to only those who need access.
