The Protection of Personal Information Act, No 4 of 2013, is applicable in this project due to data collection of personal information. We caution that due diligence be exercised when deploying the system withing a home. The act requires that the data subject gives consent or in the case of a patient with dementia, that the guardian of the patient gives consent for data collection. Compliance with the act has additional implications for security, custody of the collected data and how it may be processed.
